		<h1>Goodnight and Sweet Dreams!</h1>
		<p>Congratulations! You have reached the end of the day. Today, you got to step back in time and enjoy the simple joys of childhood. You played, explored with new adventures, and shared lots of laughs. Just for a moment you were able to be carefree and just take in the present moment. What a perfect day! </p>
